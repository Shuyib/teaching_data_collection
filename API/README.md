NB. You can install the packages in a virtual environment or globally. We used python 3.10 for this example.

pip install virtualenv
```
## Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install requests polars pandas pyarrow

We use a Makefile to run the project. The Makefile contains the following commands:

make install
```
Activate the virtual environment and run the command.
